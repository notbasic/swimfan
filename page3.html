					<h2>Not an easy one but can be done</h2>
						<p1>The breast stroke is a difficult swimming technique that requires a lot of body control
						    To be able to master this stroke you will need a lot of endurance and drive.
						    But with time and pratice you can become a master of this stroke. Never say you can do it.
						    you have to basic to do this all just because you learned how to float.<img src= "swimfan.jpg" alt="swim fan">

					 <h2>Not so difficult but still fun</h2>
						<p1>This stroke is one that can be done while relaxing. i think of this as a fall back techique.
						    Swimming on your back is like a resting position. It doesn't require as much body control as the breast stroke does.<img src= "swimfan.jpg" alt="swim fan">
